 <p>
    A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the Austrian kipferl
     but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough. Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape, the dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating.
